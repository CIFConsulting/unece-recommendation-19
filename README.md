Recommendation 19 establishes a one-digit numerical code for representing transport modes and provides for a second digit for subdivisions, which might be required. This Recommendation applies to all cases where the mode of transport is represented in coded form in international trade documents and where a simple code structure suffices.

Requests for addition to the codes should be made to the Information Content Management Group (ICG) at cefact@unece.org
